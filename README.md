# Image-processing-python
The algorithms are organized into 5 `.py` files:
- **Color Transformation (Color)**
- **Geometric Transformation (Scale_Rotation)**
- **Image Smoothing (Filtering)** (Includes both Theoretical Approaches and OpenCV)
- **Edge Detection using Theory (Edge_Detection_LT)**
- **Edge Detection using OpenCV Functions (Edge_Detection_OpenCV)**

#### How to Run the Program:
- Open the "source" folder and run each `.py` file to use the corresponding functions.
- The images used in the functions are all placed in the same folder with matching names.
